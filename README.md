P.U.S.H: Preventing Unwanted Social Harassment
Hi! Thanks for downloading P.U.S.H., the quickest way to notify your friends if you're ever in a
tough situation and need help, with just the *push* of a button!

Here's how it works:
1. Create a Group. These will be the people you notify in case something happens. After creating a
new Group, you can add a Group Name, and then add Members (with Names and Phone Numbers,
so P.U.S.H. can contact them).
Choose which Group you want to be your default Group for the night.
2. Write a Message. This will be the message that will be sent out in case you need to contact your
friends in a hurry. Just like with Groups, you can add new Messages as you please.
Just make sure you choose the Message of the Night as your Default.

Once you configure everything, go out and have fun! You'll have even more fun knowing that you will
be safe and your friends will have your back the entire night. If you ever need to push the notification,
everyone in your default Group will receive a text notification with your default Message
of the Night, and will be able to come to your rescue.

Happy P.U.S.H.ing!
