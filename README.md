P.U.S.H: Preventing Unwanted Social Harassment

An android app that is the quickest way to notify your friends if you're ever in a
tough situation and need help, with just the *push* of a button!


Here's how it works:

1. <b>Create a Group.</b> These will be the people you notify in case something happens. You can always add
Groups or delete Groups, as well as add Groups to Favorites. After creating a new Group, you can
add a Group Name, and then add Members (with Names and Phone Numbers, so P.U.S.H. can contact them).
Choose which Group you want to be your default Group for the night.

2. <b>Write a Message.</b> This will be the message that will be sent out in case you need to contact your
friends in a hurry. Just like with Groups, you can add new Messages and delete them as you please.
Just make sure you choose the Message of the Night as your Default.~~

3. <b>You're all set!</b>


Once you configure everything, don't worry about going out! In the unfortunate circumstance where 
you need to push the button, have peace of mind knowing that you will be heard by your Group and 
they will help you. 

<i>Remember, you are not alone.</i>
