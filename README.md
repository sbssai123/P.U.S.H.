P.U.S.H. is an android app that is the quickest way to notify your friends if you're ever in a
tough situation and need help, with just the *push* of a button!


Here's how it works:

1. <b>Create a Group.</b> These will be the people you notify in case something happens. You can always add Groups or delete Groups, as well as add Groups to Favorites. After creating a new Group, you can add a Group Name, and then add Members (with Names and Phone Numbers, so P.U.S.H. can contact them). Choose which Group you want to be your default Group for the night.

2. <b>Write a Message.</b> This will be the message that will be sent out in case you need to contact your friends in a hurry. P.U.S.H. uses the Bandwitdth API which does an HTTP post request to send the desired message to the Group. Just like with Groups, you can add new Messages and delete them as you please. Just make sure you choose the Message of the Night as your Default.

3. <b>Activate Notification.</b> After you have selected the desired Group and Message, press the <i>Activate</i> button on the home page of the app. This adds a stuck notification to the home screen on your phone which you can activate anytime even when your phone is locked.


Once you configure everything, don't worry about going out! In the unfortunate circumstance where 
you need to push the button, have peace of mind knowing that you will be heard by your Group and 
they will help you. 

<i>Remember, you are not alone.</i>
