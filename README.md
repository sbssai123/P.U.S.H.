P.U.S.H: Preventing Unwanted Social Harassment
Hi! Thanks for downloading P.U.S.H., the quickest way to notify your friends if you're ever in a
tough situation and need help, with just the *push* of a button!

Here's how it works:
1. Create a Group. These will be the people you notify in case something happens. You can always add
Groups or delete Groups, as well as add Groups to Favorites. After creating a new Group, you can
add a Group Name, and then add Members (with Names and Phone Numbers, so P.U.S.H. can contact them).
Choose which Group you want to be your default Group for the night.
2. Write a Message. This will be the message that will be sent out in case you need to contact your
friends in a hurry. Just like with Groups, you can add new Messages and delete them as you please.
Just make sure you choose the Message of the Night as your Default.
3. Bluetooth Connect to your Arduino button. This way, when you push the button, it will connect to
P.U.S.H. and be able to notify your friends in your selected Group.
4. You're all set!

Once you configure everything, go out and have fun! You'll have even more fun knowing that you will
be safe and your friends will have your back the entire night. If you ever need to push the Arduino
button, everyone in your default Group will receive a test notification with your default Message
of the Night, and will be able to come to your rescue.

Happy P.U.S.H.ing!
